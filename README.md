# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo is a submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data used in the project was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Here is the link to the data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

There are two files in this repository:
1) run_analysis.R includes the R script for performing the analysis as described below:
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2) CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
